- include Neutron Star merger process + yieldsets (similar to SN1a, yields from Andreas Bauswein, implementation Benoit Cote)
- include sub Chanrdasekhar SNIa process + yieldsets (yields from Fritz Roepcke)
- include yields that Oliver implemented
- implement Gibbs Sampler
- Let Chempy return -inf if SFR is below 5% of global mean (last time steps for too early peak with current parametrization)
